# My NVIM Configuration

This is forked from [nvim-lua/kickstarter.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim).

## Pre-requisite
 - [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) -> Install [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md) (obviously.)
 - [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) -> Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). This is necessary for Telescople Live Grep feature.


#### Markdown Preview
For `M1/M3` Mac OS machines, there is a need to install the plugin in rosetta first. You can fix this by deleting the `.git` folder for markdown first before reinstalling the plugin by re-opening nvim.
